# Sandy - Physics Simulation
This project was a big challenge to put together. It required me to combine my knowledge with C++ and many Physics concepts


## Features

- A particle system that currently only supports kinematic motion in 2D
- A grid-tile system in cartesian coordinates that snaps your mouse cursor to the closest avaliable tile
- Multiple particle types build on Inheritance and Polymorphism
- More comming soon!


## Authors

- Collaboration is welcomed!


## FAQ

#### Why c++?

C++ alows for great performance along with other handy features like pointers, classes, operator overloading, building with CMAKE, and the trusty STL

#### What features are comming soon?


I will be implimenting a neat GUI inorder to view
 - current allocated memory
 - pie chart of all the particle types on screen
 - ability to pause the simulation
 - explosions??? pyrotecnics???!

####

I plan on adding more physics concepts including
 - Dynamics: Masses & forces
 - Friction and Drag
 - Momentum and collision


####

Some more fun features
 - A fan that can accelerate particles - mid air
 - Ability to analize each particle's vector components, and visualize movement using arrows
